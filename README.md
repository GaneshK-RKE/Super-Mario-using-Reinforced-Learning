# Super-Mario-using-Reinforced-Learning
A python reinforced model which could pass the Super Mario Bros levels


## How it works?

Here , the mario is our agent in this environment.

The model basically sets some random in the game environment and then it receives the feedback from the environment in form of reward. Based on this feedback(reward), the agent(mario) either changes its action or continues and again gets a feedback from the environment.

It makes sure that it tries to maximise the reward.

## Code 

We have made comments in our code to increase the readability. We have also experimented in the notebook for some better understanding.
